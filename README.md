## Implementation notes
* Added responsive elements for small screens:
  * Horizontal tabs collapse into a single tab-shaped heading. Clicking the heading presents a vertical list of options.
  * "Weekly change" columns disappear for small screens, and the values are placed in the rates/apr columns.
* Vertical centering for the "Check rates in another area" form uses a silly conditional-comment table hack for IE6/7. There's a better way, butâ€¦ <http://giveupandusetables.com/>
